  Hello and welcome, I'm Jeremy, a second-year PhD student in the [Algorithmic Decision Theory](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~adt/) group at University of New South Wales, supervised by [Haris Aziz](https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/) . I'm broadly interested in topics at the intersection of microeconomic theory and algorithmics. Currently, I am primarily focused on voting problems.
