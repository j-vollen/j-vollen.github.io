  I'm Jeremy, a PhD student in the [Algorithmic Decision Theory](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~adt/) group at University of New South Wales, supervised by [Haris Aziz](https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/). I'm broadly interested in topics at the intersection of microeconomic theory and algorithmics. My current research is primarily focused on designing algorithms with desirable individual and group representation guarantees for general voting problems. <br/>

  Here is my [CV](https://j-vollen.github.io/files/CV_JeremyVollen.pdf) (updated April 2023).
  

## **What's new?** 
  *December 2023* Our paper "Fair Lotteries for Participatory Budgeting" has been accepted at AAAI 2024, to be held in Vancouver, Canada in February.

  *August 2023* At IJCAI 2023, I will be giving a talk on "Best-of-Both-Worlds Fairness in Committee Voting" at the M-PREF workshop and participating in the doctoral consortium. <br/>

 *July 2023* I am visiting [Ashish Goel](https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg) at Stanford University's Department of Management Science and Engineering. <br/>
 
 *March 2023* I've been invited to attend the [Mathematics and Computer Science of Market and Mechanism Design summer graduate school at MSRI](https://www.msri.org/summer_schools/1016) in June in Berkeley, California.
